One of the key projects I worked on was a fingerprint-based attendance tracking system. 

In this project, I developed both the hardware and software components. 

I integrated an ESP8266 microcontroller with a fingerprint sensor to capture and verify fingerprints, then sent the data to a MySQL database via PHP scripts. On the software side, 

I built an Android application using Java, which allowed users to register and verify fingerprints in real time. 

I also connected the system to Firebase Realtime Database to display attendance records dynamically. 

My role involved system design, coding, and ensuring seamless communication between hardware and software components.
