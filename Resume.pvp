Hello, my name is Pham Vinh Phu. 

I am a fresh graduate in Electronics and Telecommunications with a strong background in embedded systems and IoT. 

I have experience working with STM32, ESP8266, and Arduino, along with programming skills in C/C++, Java, and Python. 

During my internship at T4Tek, I developed a logistics management system on Odoo. I have also built projects like a fingerprint attendance system and a remote-controlled vehicle using STM32. 

I am passionate about solving real-world problems with technology and excited about new challenges in embedded development.
